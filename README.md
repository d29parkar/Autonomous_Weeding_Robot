# Autonomous Weeding Robot

Weed control has been a long-standing issue in agriculture for over a century. The uniform spraying of herbicides has proved its efficiency in weed control, but it has also introduced environmental pollution, human health concerns, and herbicide resistance fears. Precision farming offers a solution to this problem by utilising weeding mechanisms to address individual plants or small weed clusters. Human-oriented precision weeding machinery, on the other hand, typically necessitates inefficient and labor-intensive human resources, which cannot justify the economic benefits of herbicide savings.

Therefore, with this project, we have presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a compact automated weed killing robot suited to traverse in marshy and moisture laden terrains, primarily cotton fields to uproot weeds which hinder growth of young cotton saplings.

The detailed report of the project is uploaded as "Project_report.pdf" in this repository.

The overall assembly of the the robot is uploaded in "CAD Models" repo as "assem1.SLDASM".
